# Ngram (word) prediction algorithm

Here is the code for the capstone assignment of the Coursera data science course to build a shiny based app for next word prediction. It consisted of:
  
* Sampling and cleaning the data provided - publically available text.
* Conducting exploratory analysis and predictive modelling on the data, based on the frequency of occurence in English texts.
* Optimising the predictive algorithm for speed and accuracy and writing a shiny based app
  
A presentation outlining the project in more detail is available [here](http://rpubs.com/aem56/Word_Prediction2) and the shiny app is available [here](https://aem56.shinyapps.io/Word_Predictor/).
